Choose-Focus-Analyze (C-F-A) exercise: Students need to choose a problem of relevance to the industry or any human endeavour and
analyze it using the principles learnt in class. This is an open-ended exercise and designed to develop the skills of choice, focus and
analysis in students. The evaluation will be based on originality in approach: 15%, focus level: 15%, depth of analysis: 20%, quantum of
work: 20%, original contribution: 20%, presentation: 10%. A concise report submitted a week before the last day of classes will be evaluated.
It will help if the problem is chosen well in advance and sufficient time, distributed throughout the course duration, is devoted. A plagiarism
check needs to be done, and the complete report (say, Turnitin) needs to be appended to the main report.
